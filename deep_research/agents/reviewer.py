Reviewer Agent for Deep Research Multi-Agent System

This agent performs final quality assurance, completeness checking, clarity review,
and gap detection. It produces a polished final report and a structured gap list
for future research iterations.

    """
    Create the reviewer agent using the deepagents framework.
    
    The reviewer agent:
    - Reads: draft_report.md, subqueries.json, /summaries/* (optional), factcheck_notes.md (optional)
    - Writes: final_paper.md (polished report), gap_list.json (structured gap analysis)
    - Flow: Sequential (runs after synthesizer, final stage)
    - Performs: Completeness check, clarity review, conservative gap filling, gap detection
    
    Key responsibilities:
    1. Verify every sub-query from the research plan has been addressed
    2. Evaluate clarity and logical structure of the report
    3. Fill minor gaps when information can be inferred from existing sources
    4. Document moderate and major gaps in structured JSON format
    5. Generate polished final report maintaining academic standards
    6. Create actionable gap list for future research iterations
    
    Conservative gap filling principles:
    - Only fill gaps when information is explicitly stated in summaries
    - No speculation or assumptions beyond source material
    - Maintain source fidelity and citation accuracy
    - Refrain from introducing knowledge not grounded in research
